#  Technical Analysis API 

This project involves building a financial API using Go to pull data from various sources, and analyzing the data with Python to provide forecasts and recommendations.

## Stages of the Project

1. **Extraction**:
   - Extract financial from Alpha Vantage (https://www.alphavantage.co/) API to start gathering financial information.
   - For a first version, we will be using daily data to build the data workflow.

2. **Transformation**:
   - Clean and preprocess data using Python (`pandas`).
   - Perform feature engineering to create useful features.

3. **Loading**:
   - Set up a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to store cleaned data.
   - Insert transformed data into the database using  `mgo`.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Retrieve data from the database into Python.
   - Conduct statistical analysis and implement forecasting models using `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`.

5. **Forecasting and Recommendations**:
   - Train models on data to predict future trends.
   - Generate actionable insights and recommendations.

6. **Integration and Deployment**:
   - Create API endpoints to serve analysis results.
   - Deploy the application using Docker and a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Implement logging and monitoring.
   - Regularly update models and data sources.
